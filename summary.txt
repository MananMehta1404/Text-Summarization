Hurricane Gilbert 's growth from a harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters. It 's a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time, Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday. Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa. A tropical wave becomes a depression when wind start swirling. When sustained wind reach 39 mph, the system becomes a named tropical storm. It reaches hurricane status when sustained wind hit 74 mph. Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems did n't is a mystery more or less, said University of Miami meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck. But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once development begins. And they know that development is sparked when wind converge, and that growth is affected by time and place. If that happens in an area where there 's plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere -LRB- the bottom 10,000 feet or so -RRB-, this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation, Bleck said. Their primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere, he said. When the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados, warm Atlantic waters nurtured it. This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best for development, Clark said. The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, measured at 26.13 inch Tuesday night.
